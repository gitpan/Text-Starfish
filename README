Text::Starfish version 1.03
===========================
#-

The Text::Starfish module supports processing of embedded Perl code in
an arbitrary text.  Documentation is part of the file Starfish.pm
using the pod format.  To convert it into manual page format, type
something like the following:

	  pod2html Starfish.pm

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you do not have permissions to install the module in the
system-wide module repository, you can install it locally; e.g.,
perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/mydir

DEPENDENCIES

No significant dependecies, as far as I know.  Let me know if you find
something important to add.
